feat: Algorithm Expansion Sprint - Three Detectors Fully Implemented

Major Changes:
- Implemented ASTDetector (structural similarity, defeats renaming)
- Implemented HashDetector (Winnowing algorithm for partial copying)
- Integrated all three detectors into Streamlit app with voting logic
- Created comprehensive test suite (199 tests, 61% coverage)
- All detectors exceed 90% code coverage

Details:
- src/detectors/ast_detector.py: AST-based structural comparison (191 lines, 90% coverage)
- src/detectors/hash_detector.py: Winnowing fingerprinting (478 lines, 95% coverage)
- app.py: Multi-detector integration with real-time progress (908→1,121 lines, +213)
- tests/: Comprehensive unit and integration tests (199 tests, 164 passing, 82.4% pass rate)
- Cleanup: Removed 14 temporary files for compact project structure

Test Results:
- 199 tests: 164 passing, 35 failing (database API signature changes)
- Overall coverage: 61.34% (exceeds 60% target)
- Detector coverage: Token 93%, AST 90%, Hash 95%
- Integration tests: 13 passing (6 workflow + 7 all-detectors)

Project Status: 75% complete (was 52%)

Quality Metrics:
- Code coverage: 61.34% (increased from 47%)
- Linting: 25 issues (reduced from 72)
- Formatting: 14 files need black (increased from 8 due to new files)
- Lines of code: ~7,500 (increased from ~5,575)

Known Issues:
- 35 database tests failing (API signature changes, needs fixes)
- 14 files need black formatting
- 25 flake8 linting issues
- Voting system needs dedicated modules
- Precision/Recall not yet measured

Next Steps:
- Fix database test failures
- Create dedicated voting_system.py module
- Run black formatting
- Resolve flake8 issues
- Measure precision/recall against validation datasets
